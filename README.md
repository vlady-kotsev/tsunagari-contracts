## Overview

**Tsunagari**(to connect) contracts is a Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) EVM to EVM bridge smart contracts system written in Solidity and Yul, using the Forge framework.

## Features

- Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) modular upgradeability
- Security by requiring a threshold amount of signatures (n of m)
- No reliance on a centralized service

## Facets

- `DiamondCutFacet`: Manages the facets to be added, replaced, or removed.
- `DiamondLoupeFacet`: Read-only functions for querying the state of the diamond.
- `GovernanceFacet`: Manages the governance of the bridge.
- `CalculatorFacet`: Manages the mathematical calculations for the bridge.
- `TokenManagerFacet`: Manages the minting, burning, locking and unlocking of tokens.

## Deployment

Deployment to local `anvil` blockchain network:

```bash
make deploy-diamond-anvil PK=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

Deployment to **testnet** blockchain network:

```bash
make deploy-diamond-taiko PK=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

or

```bash
make deploy-diamond-base PK=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

## Testing

The smart contracts are tested with:

### Unit tests: test coverage report can be generated with:

```bash
make report
```

### Fuzz tests

### Static code analysis with **Slither**: static analysis report can be generated with:

```bash
make staic-check
```

<sub>Note: This requires slither analyzer to be installed.</sub>

### Formal verification with **Certora**: formal verification for the **Fee calculation functionality** can be run with:

```bash
make formal-verification CERTORAKEY=<CERTORA_KEY>
```

<sub>Note: This requires Certora key.</sub>
